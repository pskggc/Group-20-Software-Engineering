# Image Classifier Technology

## RJI Deep Learning inner Technology

   Image classifier technology that we used for this RJI project was pulled from the GitHub
   repository image-quality-assessment. "This repository provides an implementation of an
   aesthetic and technical image quality model based on Google's research paper "NIMA: Neural
   Image Assessment"" (image-quality-assessment, README.md). In-order to setup and configure
   this image classifier we had to install docker machine and the AWS command line interface.
   Through these requirments and applications we are able to train the machine what are good
   and bad images given to us by Ed McCain.
   
   After working on the RJI project and configuring implementation my team and I wish we had
   more time to develope our own image classifier technology. It took several weeks to understand
   what is image classification and how it exactly works. Using someone elses image quality
   assessment was difficult to understand and implemenatation was confusing. If we were to create
   our own image classifier I would create something that is able to be implemented or configured
   with several different types of systems. My team and I would also like to create something
   that has a better UI and implementing into a web application was simpler.
